# Logical Connectives
=====================

This module introduces how to work with compound propositions:
- Conjunction (`AND`, `∧`)
- Disjunction (`OR`, `∨`)
- Equivalence (`↔`) is (essentially but not exactly) just a `(_ → _) ∧ (_ → _)`

All three are right-associative. `↔` is non-associative and cannot be chained
without explicit brackets (use `trans` or `TFAE` instead).

Key tactics:
- `constructor` for splitting compound goals
- `cases` and `rcases` for basic pattern matching
- `obtain` for destructuring hypotheses
- `trans` for chaining equivalences
- `tfae` for working with lists of equivalences

## Working with AND (∧) in the goal

To prove `P ∧ Q`, we need to prove both `P` and `Q`. We can:
- Use `apply And.intro` explicitly
- Use `constructor` as shorthand
- Use angle bracket notation `⟨p, q⟩`

`constructor` is used around 3,000 times in mathlib while
`exact` followed by an `⟨⬝⟩` term is used around 7,000 times.

#check And
#check And.intro  -- takes proofs `(left : a)` and `(right : b)` and produces `(a ∧ b)`

-- Using `apply And.intro` will open two goals (one for `a` and one for `b`)

-- The linter will complain about the following formatting, even though this
-- produces valid Lean code. Without `·` focusing, the proof block simply
-- moves on to the next open goal after each tactic closes the current one.
-- Note that the order matters though, so `exact q; exact p` does not work.

#print goal_and_apply -- produces `⟨p, q⟩`, we will see this notation in a second

-- The notation hides the actual term mode proof

-- This is the recommended and much more readable syntax!
-- But note that we still need to respect the order.

#print goal_and_constructor -- also produces `⟨p, q⟩`

-- Looking at the actual term modes already introduces the angle bracket
-- notation, which we can also use: `⟨p, q⟩` is notation for `And.intro p q`
-- (assuming `p : P : Prop` and `q : Q : Prop`).
example (P Q : Prop) (p : P) (q : Q) : P ∧ Q := by
  exact ⟨p, q⟩

-- Or just use term mode with the `⟨...⟩` notation
example (P Q : Prop) (p : P) (q : Q) : P ∧ Q := ⟨p, q⟩

-- First side note: the `⟨...⟩` notation just instantiates a structure ...
example (P Q : Prop) (p : P) (q : Q) : P ∧ Q := by
  exact {
    left := p,
    right := q
  }

-- ... but it hides the names by simply ordering the components. By naming
-- them we can also determine the order in which we prove them. Recall P01S05.
example (P Q : Prop) (p : P) (q : Q) : P ∧ Q := by
  exact {
    right := q,
    left := p
  }

-- Second side note: recall that we can stack proofs in proofs
example (P Q : Prop) (p : P) (q : Q) : P ∧ Q := by
  exact ⟨by assumption, by assumption⟩

-- We can start a tactic mode sub-proof even in term mode
example (P Q : Prop) (p : P) (q : Q) : P ∧ Q := ⟨p, by assumption⟩

## Working with AND in a hypothesis

To use a hypothesis `h : P ∧ Q`, we can:

- Access components with `h.1` / `h.2` or `h.left` / `h.right`
- Use `obtain` for destructuring
- Use `cases` and `rcases` for basic pattern matching

`obtain` is used around 15,000 times in mathlib, `cases` 3,000 times,
and `rcases` 7,000 times.
-/

-- Using `.1` / `.2` notation
example (P Q : Prop) (h : P ∧ Q) : Q ∧ P := by
  constructor -- because the goal has an `∧`
  · exact h.2
  · exact h.1

-- In term mode
example (P Q : Prop) (h : P ∧ Q) : Q ∧ P := ⟨h.2, h.1⟩

-- Recalling that `And` is just a structure with `left`
-- and `right`, we can also use `.right` / `.left` notation
example (P Q : Prop) (h : P ∧ Q) : Q ∧ P := by
  constructor
  · exact h.right
  · exact h.left

-- In term mode ...
example (P Q : Prop) (h : P ∧ Q) : Q ∧ P := ⟨h.right, h.left⟩

-- ... or also
example (P Q : Prop) (h : P ∧ Q) : Q ∧ P := {
  right := h.left,
  left := h.right
}

/-
All of this works for arbitrary structures in Lean, so you can always
(de)construct an instance sequentially (by order of the arguments)

-> `⟨...⟩`, `And.intro ...`, `constructor` with `·`, `.1`, and `.2`

or by specifying the actual names of the components of the structure.

-> `{left := ..., right := ...}`, `.left`, and `.right`

## Intermission: The `repeat`, `all_goals`, `try`, and `<;>` tactics

- `repeat tac` repeatedly applies `tac` to the main goal until it fails.
- `all_goals tac` runs `tac` on each goal, concatenating the resulting goals, if any.
- `try tac` attempts to run `tac` without causing failure if it does not apply.
- `tac <;> tac'` runs `tac` on the main goal and `tac'` on each produced goal.

They are respectively used around 150, 500, 400, and 7000 times in mathlib.

## Working with OR (∨) in the goal

To prove P ∨ Q, we need to prove either P or Q. We can:

- Use `apply Or.inl`/`Or.inr` explicitly
- Use `left`/`right` as shorthand
-/

#check Or
#check Or.inl     -- takes a proof `(a : P)` and produces `(P ∨ Q)`
#check Or.inr     -- takes a proof `(b : Q)` and produces `(P ∨ Q)`

-- The most explicit way to deal with `∨` in goal is to
-- directly use `apply Or.inl` or `apply Or.inr`
theorem goal_or_apply (P Q : Prop) (p : P) : P ∨ Q := by
  apply Or.inl
  exact p

#print goal_or_apply -- gives `Or.inl p`

-- Again note that `apply` is destructive since `apply Or.inr` here
-- would have left us with a goal that cannot be proven from the assumptions.
-- example (P Q : Prop) (p : P) : P ∨ Q := by
--   apply Or.inr
--   ... now we are stuck

-- But we could have argued forward here ..
theorem goal_or_exact (P Q : Prop) (p : P) : P ∨ Q := by
  exact Or.inl p

#print goal_or_exact -- also gives `Or.inl p`

-- .. which also gives the term mode proof.
theorem goal_or_term (P Q : Prop) (p : P) : P ∨ Q := Or.inl p

#print goal_or_term -- also gives `Or.inl p`

-- Perhaps more intuitive are the `left` and `right` tactics
theorem goal_or_tactic (P Q : Prop) (p : P) : P ∨ Q := by
  left
  exact p

#print goal_or_tactic -- also gives `Or.inl p`

## Working with OR in a hypothesis

To use `h : P ∨ Q`, we can:
- Use `apply Or.elim` explicitly
- Use `cases` and `rcases`
- Use `obtain` with pattern matching
-/

-- We can deal with `∨` in a hypothesis by applying `Or.elim` directly,
-- again using `·` to structure the proof to the sub-goals. Note that
-- `Or.elim {a b c : Prop} (h : a ∨ b) (left : a → c) (right : b → c) : c`

-- Viewing `Or.elim` as a method, the most obvious thing to do is ...
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∨ Q) (p_to_r : P → R) (q_to_r : Q → R) : R := by
  exact Or.elim h p_to_r q_to_r

-- ... or even just use term mode.
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∨ Q) (p_to_r : P → R) (q_to_r : Q → R) : R :=
  Or.elim h p_to_r q_to_r

-- But if we want to get towards what we naturally expect, a case distinction,
-- we need to use `apply` ...
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∨ Q) (p_to_r : P → R) (q_to_r : Q → R) : R := by
  apply Or.elim h
  · exact p_to_r  -- Note that you do not have `p : P` in the assumptions here ...
  · exact q_to_r  -- ... and likewise you do not have `q : Q` here.

-- ... but if you really want a case distinction as you expect it, you
-- need to `intro` the hypothesis in each branch.
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∨ Q) (p_to_r : P → R) (q_to_r : Q → R) : R := by
  apply Or.elim h
  · intro p
    exact p_to_r p
  · intro q
    exact q_to_r q

-- Note that `apply` just looks for the output of the applied statement in the
-- goal and makes you prove all the assumptions of the applied statement, so
-- if we did not do the partial application `Or.elim h`, we would have gotten
-- three subgoals, since `Or.elim` takes three arguments.
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∨ Q) (p_to_r : P → R) (q_to_r : Q → R) : R := by
  apply Or.elim    -- no `h` here
  · exact h
  · exact p_to_r
  · exact q_to_r

/-
This shows why tactics are good to have: you do not need to remember `Or.elim`
or how exactly it is structured. You just use `cases`, `rcases`, or `cases'`
and get exactly the number of cases in the case distinction that you would expect.
-/

-- We can use the `cases` tactic to do a case distinction on a hypothesis ...
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∨ Q) (p_to_r : P → R) (q_to_r : Q → R) : R := by
  cases h
  · exact p_to_r (by assumption)
  · exact q_to_r (by assumption)

-- ... and if we want named variables we can also do proper pattern matching
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∨ Q) (p_to_r : P → R) (q_to_r : Q → R) : R := by
  cases h with
  | inl p => exact p_to_r p
  | inr q => exact q_to_r q

-- But most likely you should just use `rcases with _ | _` ...
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∨ Q) (p_to_r : P → R) (q_to_r : Q → R) : R := by
  rcases h with p | q  -- compare to previous `rcases h with ⟨p, q⟩`
  · exact p_to_r p
  · exact q_to_r q

-- ... or you can use `obtain _ | _ := ...`
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∨ Q) (p_to_r : P → R) (q_to_r : Q → R) : R := by
  obtain p | q := h   -- compare to previous `obtain ⟨p, q⟩ := h`
  · exact p_to_r p
  · exact q_to_r q

-- Note that `cases'` is likewise marked as deprecated by the linter.
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∨ Q) (p_to_r : P → R) (q_to_r : Q → R) : R := by
  cases' h with p q
  · exact p_to_r p
  · exact q_to_r q

## Working with nested structures

For more complex structures, we can:
- Use `rcases` for deep pattern matching
- Use `obtain` with nested patterns
-/

-- This is the brute force way ...
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∧ Q ∧ R) : Q := by
  obtain ⟨_, qr⟩ := h
  obtain ⟨q, _⟩ := qr
  exact q

-- ... but even with what we have seen there is a nicer (term mode) proof.
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∧ Q ∧ R) : Q :=
  h.right.left  -- or `h.2.1`

-- But we can also do the deconstruction of `h` in the assumptions more cleanly:
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∧ Q ∧ R) : Q := by
  obtain ⟨_, ⟨q, _⟩⟩ := h
  exact q

-- We can even get rid of the nested brackets ...
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∧ Q ∧ R) : Q := by
  obtain ⟨_, q, _⟩ := h
  exact q

-- ... but only because `∧` is right-associative: `P ∧ Q ∧ R` means `P ∧ (Q ∧ R)`.
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : (P ∧ Q) ∧ R) : Q := by
  obtain ⟨⟨_, q⟩, _⟩ := h  -- here `⟨_, q, _⟩` does not work because of `(P ∧ Q) ∧ R`
  exact q

-- Nested patterns also work with `rcases`.
example (P Q R : Prop) (h : P ∧ Q ∧ R) : Q := by
  rcases h with ⟨_, q, _⟩
  exact q

## Exercise Block B02
Try to get the proof with the fewest characters possible! You can use
[ProofGolf](https://github.com/FordUniver/ProofGolf) to measure automatically.
The scoring counts non-whitespace characters, ignoring `;` (since it is
equivalent to a newline) but counting `<;>`.

Hint: try `rintro` with nested structures

Note: `∨` is also right-associative, so the conclusion of Exercise 2.1
parses as `(P ∧ R) ∨ ((P ∧ S) ∨ ((Q ∧ R) ∨ (Q ∧ S)))`. This means
`right; right; left` is needed to reach `Q ∧ R`, for instance.
